# Sound Effects — design, catalog & integration

Generated spatial sound effects for World of ClaudeCraft, produced with the
**ElevenLabs Sound Effects API** (`POST /v1/sound-generation`) and played through
a new lightweight 3D Web Audio engine. This document is the human-readable
catalog and the asset standard; the authoritative machine list (prompts,
durations, loop flags, and stereo policy) lives in `scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs`
and is consumed by `scripts/gen_sfx.mjs` and `scripts/check_sfx.mjs`.

## Goals
- **Immersive world layer:** footsteps that change with surface (grass / dirt /
  stone / wood / snow / water), swimming, jumping/landing, weapon swings &
  material-aware impacts, per-school spell cast/projectile/impact, per-family
  creature vocalizations, and ambient loops (wind, water, campfire, forge,
  dungeon, weather).
- **Correct spatial / proximal audio:** every world sound is positioned in 3D, so
  *other* players' and creatures' footsteps and combat attenuate with distance and
  pan with direction relative to the camera. Personal UI events (level-up, loot,
  quest, coin) stay non-positional.
- **Extreme efficiency:** one decoded buffer per clip (shared), a hard concurrency
  cap, distance culling that reuses the renderer's own range gate, per-entity
  footstep throttling, pooled looping sources, and zero per-frame allocation in
  the hot path.

## What we DON'T regenerate
The existing procedural WebAudio blips in `src/game/audio.ts` (UI click, coin,
level-up fanfare, quest accept/done, bag open/close, error, whisper, duel/arena
stingers) are crisp, zero-weight, and non-positional — they stay. Generated assets
are spent only on the immersive world/combat/creature layer below.

## Asset standard

All committed files under `public/audio/sfx/` must pass
`npm run sfx:check`. The generator and checker share the constants in
`scripts/sfx/sfx_asset_standard.mjs` so the written contract and the executable
contract stay aligned.

| Rule | Standard | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Container / codec | MP3 only, one audio stream | The runtime uses WebAudio `decodeAudioData`; MP3 is the broadest baseline for WebKit/iOS and Safari. Ogg Vorbis is intentionally out of scope. AAC in `.m4a` is a possible future efficiency pass, not this standard. |
| Sample rate | 44.1kHz | Matches the ElevenLabs output profile and keeps all SFX uniform. |
| Bitrate | Generator writes 128kbps CBR MP3; hand-authored clips must be <=192kbps | Short SFX do not benefit enough from 320kbps to justify the decoded-memory and download drift. |
| Loudness | Peak-normalize to -6dBFS after channel conversion | Keeps generated and hand-authored clips at predictable relative levels with headroom for runtime gain/jitter. |
| Channels | Mono by default; `stereo: true` in the catalog means stereo | Positional and one-shot sounds are panned/spatialized at runtime, so pre-rendered stereo width is wasted. Ambient beds may keep stereo width. |
| Naming | `snake_case` key, filename exactly `<key>.mp3` | The filename, manifest key, and `scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs` key are the same identifier. |

### Channel policy by playback path

- `playAt(...)`: mono. This includes footsteps, movement, weapon swings,
  impacts, creature voices, spell projectiles, spell impacts, heals, auras, and
  sustained `cast_*` loops. They are positioned by the runtime, so stereo input is
  decoded and retained but does not add useful spatial information.
- `playUi(...)`: mono by default. UI SFX should use procedural `audio.ts` unless a
  sampled clip is clearly needed; if a future sampled UI clip is added, keep it
  mono unless a documented stereo exception is added to the catalog.
- Ambience loops: stereo. Entries such as `amb_wind_vale`, `amb_water`, and
  `amb_campfire` use `stereo: true` in `scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs` so the
  pipeline preserves left/right width.

### Naming convention

Use lowercase snake_case in the form `category_subject_variant`:

- `mob_<family>_aggro|attack|death`
- `foot_<surface>`
- `amb_*`
- `cast_<school>`, `proj_<school>`, `impact_<school>`
- `melee_*`, `combat_*`, `move_*`, `player_*`, `heal_*`, `buff_*`, `debuff_*`

The check script treats a filename that does not equal a catalog key as a
conformance error.

## Architecture

### `src/game/sfx.ts` — `Sfx` (singleton `sfx`)
A decoupled 3D engine with **its own `AudioContext` + `AudioListener`** (siblings:
`audio`/`music`/`voice`). Driven by the `sfxVolume` setting (wired alongside
`audio.setVolume` in `main.ts`). API:
- `init()` — gated on the same user gesture as `audio.init()` (`enterWorld`);
  preloads + decodes every clip in the manifest into a shared buffer cache.
- `setListener(x,y,z, fx,fy,fz)` — called once per frame by the renderer with the
  camera position + forward vector.
- `playAt(key, x,y,z, opts?)` — one-shot positional clip via a `PannerNode`
  (equalpower, linear rolloff, hard `maxDistance` cutoff). Random ±6% rate / ±2dB
  gain jitter so repeats (footsteps, swings) never machine-gun.
- `playUi(key, opts?)` — non-positional one-shot straight to the master bus.
- `loopAt(key, id, x,y,z)` / `loopGlobal(key, id)` / `stopLoop(id, fade)` /
  `setLoopTarget(...)` — pooled looping sources for ambience & sustained casts,
  cross-faded.
- Concurrency cap (`MAX_VOICES`), buffer cache, and a per-key cooldown protect the
  frame budget. Unknown keys / missing files are silent no-ops.

### Renderer integration (movement) — `src/render/renderer.ts`
Render must not import `game/`, so the renderer holds an injected
`SpatialAudioSink` interface (declared in `src/render/audio_sink.ts`); `main.ts`
wires the real `sfx` into it. In the existing per-entity `sync()` loop (~L1166–1338,
which already computes interpolated position, `loco.speed/moving`, `swimming`,
`airborne`, and squared distance `d2` to the player):
- **Footsteps:** a per-`EntityView` distance accumulator (`stepAccum += speed*dt`)
  fires `sink.footstep(x,y,z, surface, running, self)` each stride. Surface =
  `zoneBiomeAt(z)` (vale→grass, marsh→dirt, peaks→stone) → water if wading →
  dungeon→wood/stone → snow if weather is snowing. Suppressed while airborne /
  swimming / dead and gated by `d2 < SFX_RANGE_SQ`.
- **Jump / land / splash / swim:** per-view edge detection on `airborne` and
  `swimming` transitions fires `sink.movement('jump'|'land'|'splash'|'swim', …)`.
- **Listener:** after the camera is positioned (~L1583), `sink.setListener(camPos,
  forward)`.

### Combat / event integration — `src/ui/hud.ts`
`handleEvents()` (~L2991–3279) already iterates drained `SimEvent`s with live
entity positions. It imports the `sfx` singleton (precedent: it already imports
`game/audio`) and, per event, plays positional clips at the relevant entity:
- `damage` → attacker **swing** (by weapon class of source) + target **impact** (by
  school for spells, by target material for physical: flesh / metal / leather /
  bone); `kind:'miss'|'dodge'` → whiff/dodge; `kind:'parry'` → parry; `crit` →
  overlay `combat_crit`. Player-as-target physical → `player_hurt`.
- `castStart` → per-school sustained `cast_*` loop at the caster, stopped on
  `castStop`/`death`. `spellfx{fx:'projectile'}` → `proj_<school>`; `fx:'nova'` →
  `spell_nova`. `heal2`/`heal` → `heal_impact`. `aura{gained}` →
  `buff_apply`/`debuff_apply`.
- `death` → creature **family death** (mob) or `player_death`. Mob **aggro**
  vocalization fires the first time a mob deals damage (no aggro SimEvent exists).
- Personal UI events keep their existing procedural `audio.*` blips (unchanged).

### Surface & family mapping
- **Surface** (footsteps): `vale→grass`, `marsh→dirt`, `peaks→stone`, dungeon
  (`x>DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD`)→`wood`, wading (`y≤WATER_LEVEL-0.3` & not deep)→`water`,
  deep→`swim`, weather snow→`snow`. Source: `zoneBiomeAt`, `groundHeight`,
  `WATER_LEVEL` from `src/sim/world.ts`.
- **Creature family** (vocalizations): `MOBS[templateId].family` ∈ {beast,
  humanoid, murloc, spider, kobold, undead, troll, ogre, elemental, dragonkin,
  demon}, with a `wild_boar`/`elder_bristleback` → **boar** templateId override.
- **Weapon class** (swings) & **material** (impacts) derive from the source/target
  player class or mob family (plate: warrior/paladin → metal; leather: rogue/hunter/
  shaman; cloth: mage/priest/warlock/druid; undead → bone; else flesh).

## Generation and conformance

`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=… node scripts/gen_sfx.mjs [--force]` reads
`scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs`, calls `POST /v1/sound-generation` per clip
(`duration_seconds`, `prompt_influence` 0.4, `loop` per entry,
`output_format=mp3_44100_128`), writes a temporary raw MP3, and then invokes local
`ffmpeg` before the final write to `public/audio/sfx/<key>.mp3`.

The post-process step applies the catalog-driven channel count, resamples to
44.1kHz, peak-normalizes the converted signal to -6dBFS, encodes MP3 at 128kbps,
and strips metadata. Existing files are skipped unless `--force`; use
`node scripts/gen_sfx.mjs --conform-existing` to reprocess already-committed files
without calling ElevenLabs.

`npm run sfx:check` scans `public/audio/sfx` with `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg
volumedetect`. It exits non-zero and reports each file/rule violation for:

- wrong container/codec or non-`.mp3` filename,
- wrong sample rate,
- stereo where mono is required or mono where `stereo: true` is required,
- peak above -6dBFS (small codec tolerance allowed),
- bitrate above the 192kbps ceiling,
- filename/key mismatch with `scripts/sfx/sfx_prompts.mjs`.

The check is an explicit `sfx:check` script rather than part of the default gate for
now because it requires local `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`. Add it to a CI/gate tier only on
runners where those binaries are installed.

## Efficiency budget
- One decoded `AudioBuffer` per clip, shared across all sources.
- `MAX_VOICES` concurrent one-shots; over-cap plays are dropped (oldest-wins).
- Footsteps gated by `d2 < SFX_RANGE_SQ` (reuses the renderer's per-entity squared
  distance) and a per-entity stride accumulator — no timers, no per-frame alloc.
- Ambience/cast loops are a small pool of persistent sources, cross-faded by gain.
- Listener updated once per frame; panners use cheap `equalpower` + linear rolloff
  with a hard `maxDistance` so far sounds cost nothing.
